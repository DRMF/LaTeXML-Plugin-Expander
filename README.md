LaTeXML::Plugin::Doc
=======================

LaTeXML post-processing target for the DOC (MS Word), ODT (Open/LibreOffice Writer), and
DocBook formats. Still very much under development, but eventually, you should be able to
just type

latexmlc paper --destination=paper.docx

latexmlc paper --destination=paper.odt

latexml paper --format=DocBook --destination=paper.xml

to get one of the formats above.
